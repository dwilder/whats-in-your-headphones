========================

This is a Wordpress plugin that allows users to let other users know what music they're listening to via a dashboard widget. The same information can be displayed on the front end in a widget.

##Usage

Upload the plugin in the Wordpress plugin directory and activate it.

The dashboard widget is automatically displayed for all users, including a link inviting user’s to share what they’re listening to. Users can edit their current song/artist of choice in their edit profile page. Users can provide a link so other’s can check out what they’re listening to.

A widget can also be displayed on the front end if the theme has widget functionality. It includes options to set the title, and to display users’ names along with their music.
